  abstract = {Abstract In the context of neurorehabilitation, sound is being increasingly applied for facilitating sensorimotor learning. In this study, we aimed to test the potential value of auditory stimulation for improving gait in chronic stroke patients by inducing alterations of the frequency spectra of walking sounds via a sound system that selectively amplifies and equalizes the signal in order to produce distorted auditory feedback. Twenty-two patients with lower extremity paresis were exposed to real-time alterations of their footstep sounds while walking. Changes in body perception, emotion, and gait were quantified. Our results suggest that by altering footsteps sounds, several gait parameters can be modified in terms of left–right foot asymmetry. We observed that augmenting low-frequency bands or amplifying the natural walking sounds led to a reduction in the asymmetry index of stance and stride times, whereas it inverted the asymmetry pattern in heel–ground exerted force. By contrast, augmenting high-frequency bands led to opposite results. These gait changes might be related to updating of internal forward models, signaling the need for adjustment of the motor system to reduce the perceived discrepancies between predicted–actual sensory feedbacks. Our findings may have the potential to enhance gait awareness in stroke patients and other clinical conditions, supporting gait rehabilitation.},

  abstract  = {Cardiovascular disease remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the US and elsewhere, and stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite recent success in diminishing stroke incidence in the general US population, in parallel there is now a concerning propensity for strokes to happen at younger ages. Specifically, the incidence of stroke for US adults 20–44 years of age increased from 17 per 100,000 US adults in 1993 to 28 per 100,000 in 2015. Occurrence of strokes in young adults is particularly problematic as these patients are often affected by physical disability, depression, cognitive impairment and loss of productivity, all of which have vast personal, social and economic implications. These concerning trends among young adults are likely due to increasing trends in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors amongst this population including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity and diabetes, highlighting the importance of early detection and aggressive prevention strategies in the general population at early ages. In parallel and compounding to the issue, troublesome trends are evident regarding increasing rates of substance abuse among young adults. Higher rates of strokes have been noted particularly among young African Americans, indicating the need for tailored prevention and social efforts targeting this and other vulnerable groups, including the primordial prevention of risk factors in the first place, reducing stroke rates in the presence of prevalent risk factors such as hypertension, and improving outcomes through enhanced healthcare access. In this narrative review we aim to emphasize the importance of stroke in young adults as a growing public health issue and increase awareness among clinicians and the public health sector. For this purpose, we summarize the available data on stroke in young adults and discuss the underlying epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, prognosis and opportunities for timely prevention of stroke specifically at young ages. Furthermore, this review highlights the gaps in knowledge and proposes future directions moving forward.},

  abstract  = {Background. Stroke is a leading cause of neurological disability, often resulting in long-term motor impairments due to damage to cortical or subcortical motor areas. Despite the high prevalence of subcortical strokes in the clinical population, preclinical research has primarily focused on investigating and treating cortical strokes. Moreover, while both humans and animals show spontaneous recovery following stroke, little is known about how injury location affects this process. Objective. To capture the heterogeneity of human stroke and examine how stroke location affects spontaneous motor recovery following damage to cortical, subcortical, or a combination of both areas. Methods. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, was used to produce focal infarcts in the forelimb motor cortex (FMC), the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) or both the FMC and DLS in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The spontaneous recovery profile of animals was followed over an 8-week period using a battery of behavioral tasks assessing motor function and limb preference. Results. All 3 groups showed significant impairments on the Montoya staircase, beam, and cylinder tests following stroke, with the combined group (FMC + DLS) having the largest and most persistent impairments. Importantly, spontaneous recovery was not simply dependent on lesion volume, but on location, and the behavioral test employed. Conclusions. Stroke location markedly and differentially influences the level of spontaneous functional recovery, which is only captured by using multiple outcome measures. These results illustrate the need for preclinical stroke models to align with the heterogeneity of human stroke, especially with respect to lesion location, size, and outcome measures.},

  abstract = {Synchronizing movements with auditory beats, compared to visual flashes, yields divergent activation in timing-related brain areas as well as more stable tapping synchronization. The differences in timing-related brain activation could reflect differences in tapping synchronization stability, rather than differences between modality (i.e., audio-motor vs. visuo-motor integration). In the current fMRI study, participants synchronized their finger taps with four types of visual and auditory pacing sequences: flashes and a moving bar, as well as beeps and a frequency-modulated 'siren'. Behavioral tapping results showed that visuo-motor synchronization improved with moving targets, whereas audio-motor synchronization degraded with frequency-modulated sirens. Consequently, a modality difference in synchronization occurred between the discrete beeps and flashes, but not between the novel continuous siren and moving bar. Imaging results showed that activation in the putamen, a key timing area, paralleled the behavioral results: putamen activation was highest for beeps, intermediate for the continuous siren and moving bar, and was lowest for the flashes. Putamen activation differed between modalities for beeps and flashes, but not for the novel moving bar and siren. By dissociating synchronization performance from modality, we show that activation in the basal ganglia is associated with sensorimotor synchronization stability rather than modality-specificity in this task. Synchronization stability is apparently contingent upon the modality's processing affinity: discrete auditory and moving visual signals are modality appropriate, and can be encoded reliably for integration with the motor system. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Currently, motor function rehabilitation predominantly focuses on active movement training; nevertheless, the role of sensory input is usually overlooked. Sensory input is very important to motor function. Voluntary functional movement necessitates preparation, execution, and monitoring functions of the central nervous system, while the monitoring needs the participation of the sensory system. Sensory signals affect motor functions by inputting external environment information and intrinsic physiological status as well as by guiding initiation of the motor system. Recent studies focusing on sensory input-based rehabilitation training for post-stroke dyskinesia have demonstrated that sensory function has significant effects on voluntary functional movements. In conclusion, sensory input plays a crucial role in motor function rehabilitation, and the combined sensorimotor training modality is more effective than conventional motor-oriented approaches.},

We addressed this unresolved issue by examining the relationship between covert neural processes and overt behavior in the context of musical rhythm. We measured temporal prediction abilities, sensorimotor synchronization accuracy and neural entrainment to auditory rhythms as captured using an EEG frequency-tagging approach. Importantly, movement synchronization accuracy with a rhythmic beat could be explained by the amplitude of neural activity selectively locked with the beat period when listening to the rhythmic inputs. Furthermore, stronger endogenous neural entrainment at the beat frequency was associated with superior temporal prediction abilities. Together, these results reveal a direct link between cortical and behavioral measures of rhythmic entrainment, thus providing evidence that frequency-tagged brain activity has functional relevance for beat perception and synchronization.},

This article selectively reviews psychophysical and computational studies of streaming and comprehensively reviews more recent neurophysiological studies that have provided important insights into the mechanisms of streaming. On the basis of these studies, segregation of sounds is likely to occur beginning in the auditory periphery and continuing at least to primary auditory cortex for simple cues such as pure-tone frequency but at stages as high as secondary auditory cortex for more complex cues such as periodicity pitch. Attention-dependent and perception-dependent processes are likely to take place in primary or secondary auditory cortex and may also involve higher level areas outside of auditory cortex. Topographic maps of acoustic attributes, stimulus-specific suppression, and competition between representations are among the neurophysiological mechanisms that likely contribute to streaming.

  abstract = {There has been extensive work using early event-related potentials (ERPs) to study visual object processing. ERP analyses focus traditionally on mean amplitude differences, with the implicit assumption that all of the neuronal activity of interest is evoked by the stimulus in a time-locked manner from trial to trial. However, several recent studies have suggested that visual ERP components might be explained to a large extent by the partial phase resetting of ongoing activity in restricted frequency bands. Here we apply that approach to the neural processing of visual objects. We examine the single-trial dynamics of the EEG signal elicited by the presentation of noise textures, houses and faces. We show that the brain response to those stimuli is best explained by amplitude increase that is maximal in the 5- to 15-Hz frequency band. The results indicate also the presence of a substantial increase in phase coherence in the same frequency band. However, analyses of residual activity, after subtracting the mean from single trials, show that this increase in phase coherence is not due to phase resetting per se, but rather to the presence of the ERP + noise in each trial. In keeping with this idea, a simulation demonstrates that a purely evoked model of the ERP produces quantitatively very similar results. Finally, the stronger response to faces compared to other objects (the 'N170 face effect') can be explained by a pure modulation of amplitude centered in the 5- to 15-Hz band. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract  = {Contemporary strategies to promote motor recovery following stroke focus on repetitive voluntary movements. Although successful movement relies on efficient sensorimotor integration, functional outcomes often bias motor therapy toward motor-related impairments such as weakness, spasticity and synergies; sensory therapy and reintegration is implied, but seldom targeted. However, the planning and execution of voluntary movement requires that the brain extracts sensory information regarding body position and predicts future positions, by integrating a variety of sensory inputs with ongoing and planned motor activity. Neurological patients who have lost one or more of their senses may show profoundly affected motor functions, even if muscle strength remains unaffected. Following stroke, motor recovery can be dictated by the degree of sensory disruption. Consequently, a thorough account of sensory function might be both prognostic and prescriptive in neurorehabilitation. This review outlines the key sensory components of human voluntary movement, describes how sensory disruption can influence prognosis and expected outcomes in stroke patients, reports on current sensory-based approaches in post-stroke motor rehabilitation, and makes recommendations for optimizing rehabilitation programs based on sensory stimulation.},

  abstract  = {Neurophysiological research has shown that auditory and motor systems interact during movement to rhythmic auditory stimuli through a process called entrainment. This study explores the neural oscillations underlying auditory-motor entrainment using electroencephalography. Forty young adults were randomly assigned to one of two control conditions, an auditory-only condition or a motor-only condition, prior to a rhythmic auditory-motor synchronization condition (referred to as combined condition). Participants assigned to the auditory-only condition auditory-first group) listened to 400 trials of auditory stimuli presented every 800 ms, while those in the motor-only condition (motor-first group) were asked to tap rhythmically every 800 ms without any external stimuli. Following their control condition, all participants completed an auditory-motor combined condition that required tapping along with auditory stimuli every 800 ms. As expected, the neural processes for the combined condition for each group were different compared to their respective control condition. Time-frequency analysis of total power at an electrode site on the left central scalp (C3) indicated that the neural oscillations elicited by auditory stimuli, especially in the beta and gamma range, drove the auditory-motor entrainment. For the combined condition, the auditory-first group had significantly lower evoked power for a region of interest representing sensorimotor processing (4–20 Hz) and less total power in a region associated with anticipation and predictive timing (13–16 Hz) than the motor-first group. Thus, the auditory-only condition served as a priming facilitator of the neural processes in the combined condition, more so than the motor-only condition. Results suggest that even brief periods of rhythmic training of the auditory system leads to neural efficiency facilitating the motor system during the process of entrainment. These findings have implications for interventions using rhythmic auditory stimulation.},

  abstract  = {Neural entrainment, defined as unidirectional synchronization of neural oscillations to an external rhythmic stimulus, is a topic of major interest in the field of neuroscience. Despite broad scientific consensus on its existence, on its pivotal role in sensory and motor processes, and on its fundamental definition, empirical research struggles in quantifying it with non-invasive electrophysiology. To this date, broadly adopted state-of-the-art methods still fail to capture the dynamic underlying the phenomenon. Here, we present event-related frequency adjustment (ERFA) as a methodological framework to induce and to measure neural entrainment in human participants, optimized for multivariate EEG datasets. By applying dynamic phase and tempo perturbations to isochronous auditory metronomes during a finger-tapping task, we analyzed adaptive changes in instantaneous frequency of entrained oscillatory components during error correction. Spatial filter design allowed us to untangle, from the multivariate EEG signal, perceptual and sensorimotor oscillatory components attuned to the stimulation frequency. Both components dynamically adjusted their frequency in response to perturbations, tracking the stimulus dynamics by slowing down and speeding up the oscillation over time. Source separation revealed that sensorimotor processing enhanced the entrained response, supporting the notion that the active engagement of the motor system plays a critical role in processing rhythmic stimuli. In the case of phase shift, motor engagement was a necessary condition to observe any response, whereas sustained tempo changes induced frequency adjustment even in the perceptual oscillatory component. Although the magnitude of the perturbations was controlled across positive and negative direction, we observed a general bias in the frequency adjustments towards positive changes, which points at the effect of intrinsic dynamics constraining neural entrainment. We conclude that our findings provide compelling evidence for neural entrainment as mechanism underlying overt sensorimotor synchronization, and highlight that our methodology offers a paradigm and a measure for quantifying its oscillatory dynamics by means of non-invasive electrophysiology, rigorously informed by the fundamental definition of entrainment.},

Fundamental to musical behaviour, beat and meter refer to the perception of periodicities while listening to musical rhythms and often involve spontaneous entrainment to move on these periodicities. Here, we present a novel experimental approach inspired by the frequency-tagging approach to understand the perception and production of rhythmic inputs. This approach is illustrated here by recording the human electroencephalogram responses at beat and meter frequencies elicited in various contexts: mental imagery of meter, spontaneous induction of a beat from rhythmic patterns, multisensory integration and sensorimotor synchronization. Collectively, our observations support the view that entrainment and resonance phenomena subtend the processing of musical rhythms in the human brain. More generally, they highlight the potential of this approach to help us understand the link between the phenomenology of musical beat and meter and the bias towards periodicities arising under certain circumstances in the nervous system. Entrainment to music provides a highly valuable framework to explore general entrainment mechanisms as embodied in the human brain.},

Here, using a novel approach based on the recording of steady-state-evoked potentials (SS-EPs), we examine how distant brain areas supporting these processes coordinate their dynamics. The electroencephalogram was recorded while subjects listened to a 2.4-Hz auditory beat and tapped their hand on every second beat. When subjects tapped to the beat, the EEG was characterized by a 2.4-Hz SS-EP compatible with beat-related entrainment and a 1.2-Hz SS-EP compatible with movement-related entrainment, based on the results of source analysis. Most importantly, when compared with passive listening of the beat, we found evidence suggesting an interaction between sensory- and motor-related activities when subjects tapped to the beat, in the form of 1) additional SS-EP appearing at 3.6 Hz, compatible with a nonlinear product of sensorimotor integration; 2) phase coupling of beat- and movement-related activities; and 3) selective enhancement of beat-related activities over the hemisphere contralateral to the tapping, suggesting a top-down effect of movement-related activities on auditory beat processing. Taken together, our results are compatible with the view that rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization is supported by a dynamic coupling of sensory and motor related activities.},

  abstract  = {Previous neuroscience studies have provided important insights into the neural processing of third-party social interaction recognition. Unfortunately, however, the methods they used are limited by a high susceptibility to noise. Electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency tagging is a promising technique to overcome this limitation, as it is known for its high signal-to-noise ratio. So far, EEG frequency tagging has mainly been used with simplistic stimuli (e.g. faces), but more complex stimuli are needed to study social interaction recognition. It therefore remains unknown whether this technique could be exploited to study third-party social interaction recognition. To address this question, we first created and validated a wide variety of stimuli that depict social scenes with and without social interaction, after which we used these stimuli in an EEG frequency tagging experiment. As hypothesized, we found enhanced neural responses to social scenes with social interaction compared to social scenes without social interaction. This effect appeared laterally at occipitoparietal electrodes and strongest over the right hemisphere. Hence, we find that EEG frequency tagging can measure the process of inferring social interaction from varying contextual information. EEG frequency tagging is particularly valuable for research into populations that require a high signal-to-noise ratio like infants, young children and clinical populations.},

  abstract  = {Understanding complex systems such as the human brain requires characterization of the system's architecture across multiple levels of organization – from neurons, to local circuits, to brain regions, and ultimately large-scale brain networks. Here we focus on characterizing the human brain's large-scale network organization, as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We developed a highly principled approach to identify cortical network communities at the level of functional systems, calibrating our community detection algorithm using extremely well-established sensory and motor systems as guides. Building on previous network partitions, we replicated and expanded upon well-known and recently-identified networks, including several higher-order cognitive networks such as a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex, revealing 358 highly-organized subcortical parcels that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. Notably, the identified subcortical parcels are similar in number to a recent estimate of the number of cortical parcels (360). This whole-brain network atlas – released as an open resource for the neuroscience community – places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex into a single large-scale functional framework, with the potential to facilitate a variety of studies investigating large-scale functional networks in health and disease.},

  abstract  = {How specific brain networks track rhythmic sensory input over time remains a challenge in neuroimaging work. Here we show that subcortical areas, namely the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, specifically contribute to the neural tracking of rhythm. We tested patients with focal lesions in either of these areas and healthy controls by means of electroencephalography (EEG) while they listened to rhythmic sequences known to induce selective neural tracking at a frequency corresponding to the most-often perceived pulse-like beat. Both patients and controls displayed neural responses to the rhythmic sequences. However, these response patterns were different across groups, with patients showing reduced tracking at beat frequency, especially for the more challenging rhythms. In the cerebellar patients, this effect was specific to the rhythm played at a fast tempo, which places high demands on the temporally precise encoding of events. In contrast, basal ganglia patients showed more heterogeneous responses at beat frequency specifically for the most complex rhythm, which requires more internal generation of the beat. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence that these subcortical structures selectively shape the neural representation of rhythm. Moreover, they suggest that the processing of rhythmic auditory input relies on an extended cortico-subcortico-cortical functional network providing specific timing and entrainment sensitivities.},

  abstract  = {Rhythms are a fundamental and defining feature of neuronal activity in animals including humans. This rhythmic brain activity interacts in complex ways with rhythms in the internal and external environment through the phenomenon of ?neuronal entrainment?, which is attracting increasing attention due to its suggested role in a multitude of sensory and cognitive processes. Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample the environment rhythmically, while others, like audition, are faced with mostly rhythmic inputs. Entrainment couples rhythmic brain activity to external and internal rhythmic events, serving fine-grained routing and modulation of external and internal signals across multiple spatial and temporal hierarchies. This interaction between a brain and its environment can be experimentally investigated and even modified by rhythmic sensory stimuli or invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques. We provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and propose a theoretical framework of how neuronal entrainment dynamically structures information from incoming neuronal, bodily and environmental sources. We discuss the different types of neuronal entrainment, the conceptual advances in the field, and converging evidence for general principles.},

We examine the idea that neural entrainment of intrinsic oscillations underlies the processing of rhythmic stimuli in the context of simple isochronous rhythms as well as in music and speech. This has been a topic of growing interest over recent years; however, many issues remain highly controversial: how do fluctuations of intrinsic neural oscillations—both spontaneous and entrained to external stimuli—affect perception, and does this occur automatically or can it be actively controlled by top-down factors? Some of the controversy in the literature stems from confounding use of terminology. Moreover, it is not straightforward how theories and findings regarding isochronous rhythms generalize to more complex, naturalistic stimuli, such as speech and music. Here we aim to clarify terminology, and distinguish between different phenomena that are often lumped together as reflecting “neural entrainment” but may actually vary in their mechanistic underpinnings. Furthermore, we discuss specific caveats and confounds related to making inferences about oscillatory mechanisms from human electrophysiological data.},

We show that induced (non-phase-locked) GBA predicts tone onsets and persists when expected tones are omitted. Evoked (phase-locked) GBA occurs in response to tone onsets with ∼50 ms latency, and is strongly diminished during tone omissions. These properties of auditory GBA correspond with perception of meter in acoustic sequences and provide evidence for the dynamic allocation of attention to temporally structured auditory sequences.},

A review of existing evidence shows that this approach can apply to a variety of human and animal systems and tasks, whether the framing language is that of homeostasis, error correction, coupled biological oscillators, motor control, adaptive change, cognitive goal-setting, evaluation and refinement, or neural network learning. Thus, RBT provides a path for reconciliation of dynamical and information-processing accounts of action and cognition. RBT generates a class of mathematical equations, one of which, the discrete control equation (DCE), forms the basis for more detailed investigation. The primary focus here is on the application of the DCE to the temporal structure of regular human movement. Given certain conditions, the equation produces various standard (and new, more general) forms of the circle map class that governs relative phase in motor coordination and, hence, generates well-documented nonlinear "dynamical" motor phenomena such as behavioral attractors, phase transitions, critical slowing, and so on. Under certain other conditions, the DCE produces the linear stochastic timing models… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1–4 Hz) phase modulates theta (4–10 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30–50 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient oscillatory activity allows auditory cortex to structure its temporal activity pattern so as to optimize the processing of rhythmic inputs. },

Subjects tapped with their right index finger to metronome tones at a mean frequency of .8Hz during 5 conditions: (1) an isochronous rhythm condition, (2) random changes in interval durations, and while the duration of rhythmic intervals was continuously time-modulated following a cosine-wave function at (3) 3\%, (4) 7\%, and (5) 20\% of base interval. Anterior lobe cerebellar neuronal populations showed similar motor-associated activity across all conditions regardless of rhythmic time structure in vermal and hemispheric parts ipsilateral to the movements. Neuronal populations in bilateral anterior posterior lobe, especially in the simple lobule, increased their activity stepwise with each increase in tempo modulation from a steady beat. Neuronal populations in other parts of the posterior lobe showed an increase of activity only during the 20\% condition, which involved conscious monitoring of rhythmic pattern synchronization, especially on the left side contralateral to the movements. Differential cerebellar activation patterns correspond to those in contralateral primary (primary sensorimotor), ipsilateral secondary (inferior parietal close to the intraparietal sulcus) and bilateral tertiary (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) sensorimotor areas of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that distinct functional cortico-cerebellar circuits subserve differential aspects of rhythmic synchronization in regard to rhythmic motor control, conscious and subconscious response to temporal structure, and conscious monitoring of rhythmic pattern tracking.},

One possible function of such a transformation is to enable synchronization between individuals through perception of a common abstract temporal structure (e.g., during music performance). Thus, understanding the brain processes that underlie rhythm perception is fundamental to explaining musical behavior. Here, we propose that neural resonance provides an excellent account of many aspects of human rhythm perception. Our framework is consistent with recent brain-imaging studies showing neural correlates of rhythm perception in high-frequency oscillatory activity, and leads to the hypothesis that perception of pulse and meter result from rhythmic bursts of high-frequency neural activity in response to musical rhythms. High-frequency bursts of activity may enable communication between neural areas, such as auditory and motor cortices, during rhythm perception and production.},

Sensitivity to a “beat” (such as that routinely perceived in music) differs substantially between auditory and visual modalities. Here we examined beat sensitivity in each modality, and examined cross-modal influences, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain activity during perception of auditory and visual rhythms. In separate fMRI sessions, participants listened to auditory sequences or watched visual sequences. The order of auditory and visual sequence presentation was counterbalanced so that cross-modal order effects could be investigated. Participants judged whether sequences were speeding up or slowing down, and the pattern of tempo judgments was used to derive a measure of sensitivity to an implied beat. As expected, participants were less sensitive to an implied beat in visual sequences than in auditory sequences. However, visual sequences produced a stronger sense of beat when preceded by auditory sequences with identical temporal structure. Moreover, increases in brain activity were observed in the bilateral putamen for visual sequences preceded by auditory sequences when compared to visual sequences without prior auditory exposure. No such order-dependent differences (behavioral or neural) were found for the auditory sequences. The results provide further evidence for the role of the basal ganglia in internal generation of the beat and suggest that an internal auditory rhythm representation may be activated during visual rhythm perception.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the neural correlates of individual differences in the ability to synchronize to a beat. In particular, links between auditory-motor synchronization ability and characteristics of the brain's response to sound have not yet been explored. Given direct connections between the inferior colliculus (IC) and subcortical motor structures, we hypothesized that consistency of the neural response to sound within the IC is linked to the ability to tap consistently to a beat. Here, we show that adolescent humans who demonstrate less variability when tapping to a beat have auditory brainstem responses that are less variable as well. One of the sources of this enhanced consistency in subjects who can steadily tap to a beat may be decreased variability in the timing of the response, as these subjects also show greater between-trial phase-locking in the auditory brainstem response. Thus, musical training with a heavy emphasis on synchronization of movement to musical beats may improve auditory neural synchrony, potentially benefiting children with auditory-based language impairments characterized by excessively variable neural responses. © 2013 the authors.},

This is potentially detrimental to walking performance, as an executive control strategy is not optimized for locomotor control. Furthermore, it places excessive demands on a limited pool of executive reserves. The result is compromised ability to perform basic and complex walking tasks and heightened risk for adverse mobility outcomes including falls. Strategies for rehabilitation of automaticity are not well defined, which is due to both a lack of systematic research into the causes of impaired automaticity and to a lack of robust neurophysiological assessments by which to gauge automaticity. These gaps in knowledge are concerning given the serious functional implications of compromised automaticity. Therefore, the objective of this article is to advance the science of automaticity of walking by consolidating evidence and identifying gaps in knowledge regarding: (a) functional significance of automaticity; (b) neurophysiology of automaticity; (c) measurement of automaticity; (d) mechanistic factors that compromise automaticity; and (e) strategies for rehabilitation of automaticity.},

As we review here, new insights into these issues are emerging from the application of intervention approaches. In these approaches, the timing of brain oscillations is manipulated by non-invasive brain stimulation, either through sensory input or transcranially, and the behavioural consequence then monitored. Notably, such manipulations have led to rapid, periodic fluctuations in behavioural performance, which co-cycle with underlying brain oscillations. Such findings establish a causal relationship between brain oscillations and behaviour, and are allowing novel tests of longstanding models about the functions of brain oscillations.},

Auditory rhythms rapidly entrain motor responses into stable steady synchronization states below and above conscious perception thresholds. Studying the neural dynamics of entrainment by measuring brain wave responses (MEG) we found nonlinear scaling of M100 amplitudes generated in primary auditory cortex relative to changes in the period of the rhythmic interval during subliminal and supraliminal tempo modulations. In recent brain imaging studies we have described the neural networks involved in motor synchronization to auditory rhythm. Activated regions include primary sensorimotor and cingulate areas, bilateral opercular premotor areas, bilateral SII, ventral prefrontal cortex, and, subcortically, anterior insula, putamen, and thalamus. Within the cerebellum, vermal regions and anterior hemispheres ipsilateral to the movement became significantly activated. Tracking temporal modulations additionally activated predominantly right prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and intraparietal regions as well as posterior cerebellar hemispheres. Furthermore, strong evidence exists for the substantial benefits of rhythmic stimuli in rehabilitation training with motor disorders.},

  abstract = {<p>Motor learning is based on motor perception and emergent perceptual-motor representations. A lot of behavioral research is related to single perceptual modalities but during last two decades the contribution of multimodal perception on motor behavior was discovered more and more. A growing number of studies indicates an enhanced impact of multimodal stimuli on motor perception, motor control and motor learning in terms of better precision and higher reliability of the related actions. Behavioral research is supported by neurophysiological data, revealing that multisensory integration supports motor control and learning. But the overwhelming part of both research lines is dedicated to basic research. Besides research in the domains of music, dance and motor rehabilitation, there is almost no evidence for enhanced effectiveness of multisensory information on learning of gross motor skills. To reduce this gap, movement sonification is used here in applied research on motor learning in sports. Based on the current knowledge on the multimodal organization of the perceptual system, we generate additional real-time movement information being suitable for integration with perceptual feedback streams of visual and proprioceptive modality. With ongoing training, synchronously processed auditory information should be initially integrated into the emerging internal models, enhancing the efficacy of motor learning. This is achieved by a direct mapping of kinematic and dynamic motion parameters to electronic sounds, resulting in continuous auditory and convergent audiovisual or audio-proprioceptive stimulus arrays. In sharp contrast to other approaches using acoustic information as error-feedback in motor learning settings, we try to generate additional movement information suitable for acceleration and enhancement of adequate sensorimotor representations and processible below the level of consciousness. In the experimental setting, participants were asked to learn a closed motor skill (technique acquisition of indoor rowing). One group was treated with visual information and two groups with audiovisual information (sonification vs. natural sounds). For all three groups learning became evident and remained stable. Participants treated with additional movement sonification showed better performance compared to both other groups. Results indicate that movement sonification enhances motor learning of a complex gross motor skill—even exceeding usually expected acoustic rhythmic effects on motor learning.</p>},

In this study, we evaluated afferent sensory pathway information transfer and processing after stroke with the coherence between cortical activity and a position perturbation (position-cortical coherence, PCC). Eleven subacute stroke survivors participated in this study. Subjects performed a motor task with the affected and non-affected arm while continuous wrist position perturbations were applied. Cortical activity was measured using EEG. PCC was calculated between position perturbation and EEG at the contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor area. The presence of PCC was quantified as the number of frequencies where PCC is larger than zero across the sensorimotor area. All subjects showed significant contralateral PCC in affected and non-affected wrist tasks. Subjects with poor motor function had a reduced presence of contralateral PCC compared with subjects with good motor function in the affected wrist tasks. Amplitude of significant PCC did not differ between subjects with good and poor motor function. Our results show that poor motor function is associated with reduced sensory pathway information transfer and processing in subacute stroke subjects. Position-cortical coherence may provide additional insight into mechanisms of recovery of motor function after stroke.},

Previous studies have shown that several motor areas respond when attending to rhythms. Here we investigate whether specific motor regions respond to beat in rhythm. We predicted that the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA) would respond in the presence of a regular beat. To establish what rhythm properties induce a beat, we asked subjects to reproduce different types of rhythmic sequences. Improved reproduction was observed for one rhythm type, which had integer ratio relationships between its intervals and regular perceptual accents. A subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that these rhythms also elicited higher activity in the basal ganglia and SMA. This finding was consistent across different levels of musical training, although musicians showed activation increases unrelated to rhythm type in the premotor cortex, cerebellum, and SMAs (pre-SMA and SMA). We conclude that, in addition to their role in movement production, the basal ganglia and SMAs may mediate beat perception.},

  abstract = {Objective
              There is emerging confidence that quantitative EEG (qEEG) has the potential to inform clinical decision-making and guide individualized rehabilitation after stroke, but consensus on the best EEG biomarkers is needed for translation to clinical practice. This study investigates the spatial qEEG spectral and symmetry distribution in patients with a left/right hemispheric stroke, to evaluate their side-specific prognostic power in post-acute rehabilitation outcome.
              Methods
              Resting-state 19-channel EEG recordings were collected with clinical information on admission to intensive inpatient rehabilitation (within 30 days post stroke), and six months post stroke. After preprocessing, spectral (Delta-to-Alpha Ratio, DAR) and symmetry (pairwise and hemispheric Brain Symmetry Index) features were extracted. Patients were divided into Affected Right and Left (AR/AL) groups, according to the location of their lesion. Within each group, DAR was compared between homologous electrode pairs and the pairwise difference between pairs was compared across pairs in the scalp. Then, the prognostic power of qEEG admission metrics was evaluated by performing correlations between admission metrics and discharge mBI values.
              Results
              Fifty-two patients with hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (20 females, 38.5 \%, median age 76 years [IQR = 22]) were included in the study. DAR was significantly higher in the affected hemisphere for both AR and AL groups, and, a higher frontal (to posterior) asymmetry was found independent of the side of the lesion. DAR was found to be a prognostic marker of 6-months modified Barthel Index (mBI) only for the AL group, while hemispheric asymmetry did not correlate with follow-up outcomes in either group.
              Discussion
              While the presence of EEG abnormalities in the affected hemisphere of a stroke is well recognized, we have shown that the extent of DAR abnormalities seen correlates with disability at 6 months post stroke, but only for left hemispheric lesions. Routine prognostic evaluation, in addition to motor and functional scales, can add information concerning neuro-prognostication and reveal neurophysiological abnormalities to be assessed during rehabilitation.},

Physiol Rev 84: 541–577, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00029.2003.—Amplitude modulation (AM) is a temporal feature of most natural acoustic signals. A long psychophysical tradition has shown that AM is important in a variety of perceptual tasks, over a range of time scales. Technical possibilities in stimulus synthesis have reinvigorated this field and brought the modulation dimension back into focus. We address the question whether specialized neural mechanisms exist to extract AM information, and thus whether consideration of the modulation domain is essential in understanding the neural architecture of the auditory system. The available evidence suggests that this is the case. Peripheral neural structures not only transmit envelope information in the form of neural activity synchronized to the modulation waveform but are often tuned so that they only respond over a limited range of modulation frequencies. Ascendingthe auditory neuraxis, AM tuning persists but increasingly takes the form of tuning in average firing rate, rather than synchronization, to modulation frequency. There is a decrease in the highest modulation frequencies that influence the neural response, either in average rate or synchronization, as one records at higher and higher levels along the neuraxis. In parallel, there is an increasing tolerance of modulation tuning for other stimulus parameters such as sound pressure level, modulation depth, and type of carrier. At several anatomical levels, consideration of modulation response properties assists the prediction of neural responses to complex natural stimuli. Finally, some evidence exists for a topographic ordering of neurons according to modulation tuning. The picture that emerges is that temporal modulations are a critical stimulus attribute that assists us in the detection, discrimination, identification, parsing, and localization of acoustic sources and that this wide-ranging role is reflected in dedicated physiological properties at different anatomical levels. },

  abstract = {Having information from multiple senses converge onto the same neurons allows the neurons to work in concert so that their combined product can enhance the physiological salience of an event, increase the ability to render a judgment about its identity, and initiate responses faster than would otherwise be possible.This interactive synergy among the senses, or 'multisensory integration', is manifested in individual neurons, by enhancing or degrading their responses, and in behaviour, by producing corresponding alterations in performance.Multisensory integration is guided by principles that relate to the spatial and temporal relationship among cross-modal stimuli, as well as to the vigor of the neuron's responses to their individual component stimuli.The spatial principle of multisensory integration relies on faithful register among a neuron's different receptive fields and this register must be maintained in spite of independent movement of the sense organs (such as the eyes). Recent studies suggest that compensation for such movement is less than perfect, and occurs to varying degrees in different neurons and brain regions. Degradation in receptive-field register has strong implications for multisensory integration, but these remain to be examined empirically.Multisensory integration is crucial for high-level cognitive functions in which considerations such as semantic congruence might determine its neural products and the perceptions and behaviours that depend on them.Multiple approaches have demonstrated the impact of multisensory integration in different brain structures in different species, including single-neuron and event-related-potential recordings and brain-imaging techniques.Primary, sensory-specific areas of the brain have now been shown to receive inputs from other senses. The functional role of these other inputs is not yet known, but they might facilitate the processing of information in the native sense.},

  abstract = {How do we find what we are looking for? Even when the desired target is in the current field of view, we need to search because fundamental limits on visual processing make it impossible to recognize everything at once. Searching involves directing attention to objects that might be the target. This deployment of attention is not random. It is guided to the most promising items and locations by five factors discussed here: bottom-up salience, top-down feature guidance, scene structure and meaning, the previous history of search over timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, and the relative value of the targets and distractors. Modern theories of visual search need to incorporate all five factors and specify how these factors combine to shape search behaviour. An understanding of the rules of guidance can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of socially important search tasks, from security screening to medical image perception.},

  abstract = { Perceiving the body influences how we perceive and respond to stimuli in the world. We investigated the respective effects of different components of bodily representation—the senses of ownership and agency—on responses to simple visual stimuli. Participants viewed a video image of their hand on a computer monitor presented either in real time, or with a systematic delay. Blocks began with an induction period in which the index finger was (i) brushed, (ii) passively moved, or (iii) actively moved by the participant. Subjective reports showed that the sense of ownership over the seen hand emerged with synchronous video, regardless of the type of induction, whereas the sense of agency over the hand emerged only following synchronous video with active movement. Following induction, participants responded as quickly as possible to the onset of visual stimuli near the hand by pressing a button with their other hand. Reaction time was significantly speeded when participants had a sense of agency over their seen hand. This effect was eliminated when participants responded vocally, suggesting that it reflects priming of manual responses, rather than enhanced stimulus detection. These results suggest that vision of one's own hand—and, specifically, the sense of agency over that hand—primes manual motor responses. },

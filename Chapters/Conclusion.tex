% Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke That Includes the Premotor Cortex Reduces Mobility Outcome
% Dynamic modulation of interlimb and interjoint movement patterns is a key feature of lower-limb motor behavior that is commonly impaired after stroke. As a result, individuals living with poststroke disability have reduced mobility, increased fall risk, and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology and secondary strokes.3 Historically, functional brain networks for lower-limb control have been technically challenging to investigate in humans, thus the neural mechanisms underpinning mobility behavior and recovery after stroke remain elusive.4 (Motor Cortical Network Flexibility is Associated With Biomechanical Walking Impairment in Chronic Stroke
